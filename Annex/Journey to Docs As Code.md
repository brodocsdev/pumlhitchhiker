# Journey to Documentation as Code

My journey to Documentation as Code began over a decade ago when either
no documentation, or MS Word Documents were common. In more organised
companies, these documents were maintained in MS Sharepoint.

Working as part of a large multi-national, I championed the use of
Living Documents (Confluence was the tool used as we were using
Atlassian tool suite).

My view today is that the documentation of software should live as close
as possible to the software it is describing (e.g. same source code
repository). It can then be published to multiple formats or platforms
from there for consumption.

Having powerful tools like PlantUML and Sphinx enable this.

Documentation in this case

1.  refers to diagrams or models, user stories, requirements, guides
    etc...
2.  is useful to guide the software architecture, implementation,
    development, and maintainance

## My View On Documentation From 2013

Below is what I wrote at the time and I still believe it - even more so
now.
