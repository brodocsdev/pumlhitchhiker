#  PlantUML Hitchhiker


See published version with [brodocs.io](https://brodocs.io/975abcb773619a787f7/pumlhitchhiker/README.html)  
Repo: todo


This is remake of great work stored [here](https://github.com/Crashedmind/PlayingWithPlantUMLSource) in reStructuredText and published [here](https://crashedmind.github.io/PlantUMLHitchhikersGuide/). Files have been converted to Markdown format, which seems to have gained more popularity over the years, with no additional tags related to some specific static site generator, so that one can have good user experience when working on technical docs in editor. This is initial version, the work is still ongoing.

> **💡 Note:** There is  ```.vscode/settings.json``` committed with configuration of 
> [Explorer sort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jinchanghyeok.explorer-sort) Visual Studio Code plugin 
> which allows to set any custom order in explorer tree, so when you open this repo in VSC, you should see the same order as in published version.
